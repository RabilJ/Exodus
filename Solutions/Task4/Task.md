### The task
You are given a Calculator class. Create unit tests using NUnit. More tests is better.


### Acceptance Criteria
* You should have one method that runs before and one after test execution
* At least one method using TestCase attribute
* All methods and paths should be verified


### Remarks

It's worth noting that there are two methods of setting up or disposing after test method.
One is for setting up resources once before all tests and one is for setting up before every test,
the same goes for disposing those resources.
Any will do for the purpose of this task but it's worth remembering both exist.
